# AI vs Human-Generated Image Detection

This project explores the problem of **detecting whether an image was created by a human or generated by an AI model**.  
The notebook `ai-vs-human-generated-image-detection.ipynb` contains an end-to-end experiment — from dataset preparation and model training to evaluation and export.  

A companion script is provided to convert the trained PyTorch model into **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** format for lightweight deployment on mobile or edge devices.

## Overview

With the rapid growth of AI-generated media, being able to identify synthetic content is increasingly important for digital authenticity and media forensics.  
This experiment demonstrates how a deep learning model can learn to distinguish AI-generated images (e.g., from diffusion models) from real, human-created ones.

The workflow includes:
1. **Data preparation** – loading, labeling, and preprocessing human vs AI-generated images.  
2. **Model building** – defining and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch.  
3. **Evaluation** – assessing model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and sample visualizations.  
4. **Model conversion** – exporting the trained PyTorch model to ONNX and then to TensorFlow Lite.
